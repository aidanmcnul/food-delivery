# Neighborhood With the Worst Quality of Life
## Final Project
### Team 23 

Using collections of publically available data we are attempting to determine the worst potential neighborhood to live in with the worst quality of life.

In our decision we are drawing upon 3 main criteria

  1. Police Incident Reports, https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data/resource/391942e2-25ef-43e4-8263-f8519fa8aada , Brandon Allan - bja69@pitt.edu
  2. Fatal Accidental Overdoses (A)
  3. Firearm Seizures
